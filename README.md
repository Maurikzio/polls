Super Poll is a small app where you can create a poll and share the link to other users, so they could be able to participate in the voting process of your poll.

## Instructions/Download

2-Access to the project directory and run in the terminal: 'npm install' to install all the packages needed for the project.

## Functionality and Pages
Super-Poll is using the localstorage, in local storage will be 2 users. You can choose any of those users for creating the Poll and share its link. 

On the Home page you will see a form where you will be able to create a Poll, you will need to insert the Poll question, and the options. 
Automatically while you are creating your Poll in the rigth side you will see a preview of it, so you can have a look about how it gonna look. You will beabor to create as much choices you want, when you are writing your last choice automatically a new one field will be created for you and of course you can remove this new field cliking on the 'X' in the right side of the field.

When you are done with the title and options you will need to save your poll clicking on the save button.

On the page My Polls you will be able to see your polls, there are info about the polls you have created like the number of votes and the percentage of each of the options selected/voted. Also you will see the link of the Poll you can selected the link and copy it, but I recommend you to click on the Copy poll link button which copies the link in the clippboard and make our lifes easy.

With the link copied you can open and test it openning it in a new tab and vote your desired option, if you voted already, the vote button will be disabled.

On the page All Polls is like the My Polls page, but in this case you will be able to see all the polls created by all the users, the copy and voting procedure is the same as on the My Polls page.

We can swtich the users for creating and sharing the poll links, you just need to click on Users it is located in the topbar nest to All Polls. When you select one of the users the most right part of the top you will be able to see the selected user.


Enjoy it :)
